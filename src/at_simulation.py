AEM Transport Simulation: main simulation class and supporting functions.

This module implements the Analytic Element Method (AEM) transport model for
simulating steady-state contaminant plumes in groundwater. The core workflow is:

  1. Load a configuration of source elements (circles, lines, ellipses)
  2. For vertical orientation, add mirror images to enforce the
     water-table boundary condition
  3. Solve a least-squares system for Mathieu function expansion coefficients
     that satisfy the prescribed concentration on each element's boundary
  4. Evaluate the concentration field on a grid across the domain
  5. Post-process: find L_max (plume length), validate, plot, save results

The module uses multiprocessing to parallelize the grid evaluation and
vectorized Mathieu function calls to reduce numpy overhead across all
expansion orders simultaneously.

    inf, and 0 * inf is nan. The product itself is still a perfectly ordinary
    number out there. It is only the two halves that cannot be written down on
    their own, because log|Ke| is close to -beta*x and the two nearly cancel.

    taken out first, so every exponential actually evaluated has an argument of
    zero or less and cannot overflow.

             match prescribed concentrations on all element boundaries.
          3. conc_array — parallel evaluation of the concentration field on
             the domain grid.
          4. Dynamic domain extension — if the plume reaches the x-boundary
             (dom_xmax) or the bottom z-boundary (dom_ymin), extends that
             boundary and recomputes. Repeats up to MAX_EXTENSIONS times.
             dom_ymax is never extended: in vertical orientation it is pinned
             at the water table (y=0). Avoids wasting a full fine-grid pass on
             an undersized domain.
          5. Post-processing — L_max calculation, x/vertical domain and
             concentration range checks.
          6. Output — input plot, statistics file, error plot, result plot,
             all saved under sim_runs/<run_index>_<label>/.

             in either direction (_find_coupling_groups).
          2. If allow_decoupling is true and the graph splits into more than
             one group, solve the groups separately (_solve_decoupled_iterative).
             Each group's field at the other groups' control points is computed
             in log space and subtracted from their right-hand sides, iterating
             until the log coefficients settle. The condition number is not used.
          3. Otherwise, solve all elements as one equilibrated system.

        Decoupling keeps distant sources correct; it is not a speed-up. Along x
        the cross-term Ke decays roughly like exp(-beta*dx), so beyond about
        709/beta (2836 m at alpha_l = 2) it underflows to exactly zero in the
        coupled matrix, while the upstream plume still reaches the downstream
        source with O(1) strength. A coupled solve then misses an interaction
        that the log-space field evaluation includes, and past about twice that
        span the coupled system cannot be equilibrated at all.

        "Decoupled" groups therefore still interact; they are solved separately
        because their interaction cannot be held in a float64 matrix. The
        1e-300 floor sits just above float64 underflow, so pairs the coupled
        solve can still represent stay coupled.

          - Blue filled contours for acceptor concentrations (C < 0)
